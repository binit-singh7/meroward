# 1. Introduction

## 1.1 Purpose

The purpose of this Software Requirements Specification (SRS) is to define the functional and non-functional requirements of **NirmanSathi**, an integrated residential construction governance and marketplace platform for Nepal.

This document serves as the primary reference for the analysis, design, development, testing, and maintenance of the system. It provides a clear understanding of the system requirements for developers, project supervisors, and stakeholders involved in the project.

The SRS also establishes a common understanding of the project's scope and ensures that all development activities remain consistent with the approved project proposal and feasibility study.

## 1.2 Scope

NirmanSathi is a web-based platform that integrates residential construction governance services with a construction material marketplace.

The current implementation focuses on digitizing the building permit application process while providing an online marketplace for construction materials. Citizens can submit building permit applications, upload supporting documents, track application status, and purchase construction materials through a simulated eSewa payment workflow.

The project includes the following major modules:

- User Authentication
- Role-Based Access Control
- Citizen Registration
- Province, District, Municipality and Ward Management
- Building Permit Management
- Document Upload
- Permit Approval Workflow
- Application Status Tracking
- Construction Material Marketplace
- Shopping Cart
- Simulated eSewa Payment
- Order History

Future versions of NirmanSathi may include architect and contractor marketplaces, equipment rental services, GIS integration, AI-assisted blueprint validation, and official digital payment gateway integration.

# 2. Overall Description

## 2.1 Product Perspective

NirmanSathi is a web-based application developed to integrate residential construction governance services with a construction material marketplace. It provides a single platform where citizens can apply for building permits while also purchasing construction materials online.

The system is designed using a modular architecture, allowing future expansion without affecting the existing modules. The current implementation focuses on building permit management and a construction material marketplace to satisfy the requirements of the E-Governance course.

2.2 Product Functions

The major functions provided by the system are:

### E-Governance Module

- User Registration and Login
- Role-Based Access Control
- Citizen Profile Management
- Province, District, Municipality and Ward Management
- Building Permit Application
- Supporting Document Upload
- Permit Review and Approval
- Application Status Tracking

### Marketplace Module

- Product Category Management
- Construction Material Management
- Shopping Cart
- Simulated eSewa Payment
- Order Management
- Order History

## 2.3 User Classes and Characteristics

The system consists of four primary user roles.

| User                 | Responsibilities                                                                                                                                                           |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Citizen              | Register an account, submit building permit applications, upload documents, track application status, browse construction materials, place orders, and view order history. |
| Municipality Officer | Review permit applications, verify submitted documents, approve or reject applications, and update application status.                                                     |
| Material Supplier    | Manage construction material listings, update product information, and process customer orders.                                                                            |
| System Administrator | Manage users, locations, system configuration, and monitor overall system operations.                                                                                      |

## 2.4 Operating Environment

The system will operate in the following environment.

| Component        | Technology                                     |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Operating System | Windows 10/11                                  |
| Backend          | Django (Python 3.x)                            |
| Frontend         | HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript               |
| Database         | PostgreSQL                                     |
| Browser          | Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox |
| Version Control  | Git and GitHub                                 |

## 2.5 Design Constraints

The development of NirmanSathi is subject to the following constraints:

- The project must be completed within the academic semester.
- The system will be developed using Django as the backend framework.
- PostgreSQL will be used as the database management system.
- A simulated eSewa payment workflow will be implemented instead of real payment gateway integration.
- The project focuses only on residential building permit management and a construction material marketplace.
- Advanced features such as GIS integration, AI-assisted blueprint validation, mobile applications, and real payment gateway integration are outside the scope of the current implementation.

## 2.6 Assumptions and Dependencies

The development of NirmanSathi is based on the following assumptions and dependencies:

- Users have access to a stable internet connection.
- Municipality officers will verify applications through the system.
- Citizens will provide accurate information and valid supporting documents.
- Product information entered by material suppliers is assumed to be accurate.
- The system depends on Django, PostgreSQL, Bootstrap, and GitHub for development and deployment.
- The simulated eSewa payment process is intended for demonstration purposes only and does not perform real financial transactions.
